# IGCSE_History_Notes
My IGCSE useless notes, majorly from scanning the old hand written notes
Totally useless and have potential hazards, including:
* Pain due to unreadbale text
* Reduction in marks of test paper
* change of knowledge due to the change of syllabus

The reader should consider about these impact before reading the notes
